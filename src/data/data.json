    "description": "Stanford researchers developed an AI system that outperforms human doctors in diagnosing complex medical cases.",
    "content": "AI integration into robotic surgery is transforming how complex procedures are performed. Traditional robotic systems, like the da Vinci Surgical System, have already improved surgical precision and control. However, the addition of AI allows these systems to analyze vast amounts of surgical data, recognize patterns, and assist surgeons in real-time. This capability enhances decision-making, reduces human error, and allows for continuous learning, making the robots smarter with each procedure.",

    "content": "Apple is reportedly planning to launch its first foldableiPhone -- the iPhone Fold in 2026. Now, the latest leaks related tothe device have revealed some crucial information. According to Taiwaneseresearch firm TrendForce, the upcoming foldable iPhone could sporta 7.8-inch inner display and a 5.5-inch outer display. These numbers matchearlier predictions from well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.In comparison, Samsung’s latest foldable phone the Galaxy Z Fold 7 currently comes with an 8-inch inner display and a 6.5-inch outer screen. It means the upcoming foldable device from Apple will be a little thicker than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.Apple iPhone Fold Launch Timeline And PriceThe foldable iPhone is expected to launch in the second half of 2026, with a possible debut in September. In terms of pricing, according to a report by MacRumors, the iPhone Fold will reach the US shores at a price range between $1,800 to $2,000. That converts to between Rs 1,54,676 to Rs 1,71,862.",

    "content": "Imagine scrolling through your social media feed, sending a message, or skipping a song without tapping a button or resorting to voice commandsjustasubtletwitchofyour hand. That’s the wild promise of Meta’s latest research, and it’s not some distant sci-fi dream.Thanks to a new study published in Nature,we’regettinga sneak peek at how augmented reality (AR) glasses could soon read your intentions before you even fully act on them.Meta’s Reality Labs has been quietly working onatech called surface electromyography (sEMG), which sounds complicated but boils down to one simple idea: detecting the tiny electrical signals your muscles send when youeventhink about moving. Instead of waving your arms around or using a bulky controller, you slip on a lightweight armband. Trained on data from thousands of people, thesystem deciphers minute electrical patterns that the brain sends to your fingers.One test user typed at over 20 words per minute just thinking the stroke motions. The teamsmashed the key hurdles: generalization across users (so it doesn’t need per‑person calibration), consistent gesture recognition, and handwriting decoding, all embedded ina wristband-style interface.The big deal here is speed and subtlety. Current AR controls rely on voice, hand tracking (needs big gestures), or clunky remotes. In its Nature paper, Meta showed off Orion, a prototype wristband that predicted gestures with scary accuracy, even when people barely moved. It worked while typing on a keyboard or holding a coffee without needing to pause your life to interact with tech.",
